## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

None of my personal repositories make much sense without context; as they were examples I wrote for friends, or random experiments. The best ones here are probably the mostly-unmodified forks of `NBTExplorer` and `Substrate` (`neoNBTExplorer` and `neoSubstrate`). That should give you an idea of what you're dealing with.

### Projects that (sort of) matter

The actual projects I care about live in their own organisations:

- **T-1F9C0** â€“ Dead. None of the useful code ever made it to GitHub.
- **Scollus** â€“ Dead. Technically complete, but closed-source (and was going to be rewritten anyway).
- **FlyWay Chat** â€“ Alive. Development is slow thanks to real life, but it's the most promising of all. It has an actual philosophical reason to exist, so once fully implemented, it could be revolutionary from both a technical and practical standpoint.

As for my older personal projects (from previous GitHub accounts), I highly doubt I'll archive them here. If you remember me (and I trust you), you can contact me on Discord (`@mallardluna`) asking for something in specific, and I might be able to send it to you. There are just way too many, and I don't have the time to sort through them all.
