## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

None of my personal repositories make much sense without context; as they were examples I wrote for friends, or random experiments. The best ones here are probably the mostly-unmodified forks of `NBTExplorer` and `Substrate` (`neoNBTExplorer` and `neoSubstrate`). That should give you an idea of what you're dealing with.

### Projects that (sort of) matter

The actual projects I care about live in their own organisations:

- **FlyWay Chat** – In hiatus. Its philosophy stays, but I'm rethinking its execution.
- **T-1F9C0** – Dead. None of the useful code ever made it to GitHub.
- **MTPinder** – In hiatus. Meant for personal use, but could be useful to other macOS+Android users.

As for my older personal projects (from previous GitHub accounts), I highly doubt I'll archive them here. If you remember me (and I trust you), you can contact me at mallardluna[at]outlook.com, and I might be able to send something specific to you. There are just way too many, and I don't have the time to sort through them all.
